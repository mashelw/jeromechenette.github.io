  <h2>Coding From An Empty Cup</h2>
  <h1>Compare Arrays and Hashes in Ruby</h1>
  <h4>February 1, 2015</h4>

<h1>Arrays & Hashes</h1>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>Arrays and Hashes are both a collection of information. The difference is in how the information is referenced( a collections of key-value pairs). In an array the information is stored and then refrenced by its index. The key is an integer that defines its index of the array. For example array_example = [index0, index1, index3, index4]. In hashes any object can be utilized as a key. Both arrays and hashes can store strings, integers, floats, </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>array_example = ["farley", "Ashley", "Killer"]</p>
<p>This is an array of the names of my favorite pets</p>
<p>If i wished to call the first object in the array I would do so by: array_example[0]</p>
<p>This is, essentially, asking for the object that is in the first index of that array. This is efficient but it is a vulnerable method of refernceing objects in because the sorting of the objects in an array may change, be deleted, be added, etc.</p>
<p>To take the above example:array_example = ["farley", "Ashley", "Killer"] and make it into a hash.</p>
<h2>Hashes</h2>
<p>hash_example = {'cat'=> 'Farley', 'Dog'=>"Ashley", "Reptile"=>'Killer'}</p>
<p>In this example we are assigning the key (cat) to the value (Farley).</p>
<p>If I wished to see the names of my favorite cat I would call on: hash_example['cat'] </p>
<p>my_hash = {</p>
 <p> key1: "value1",</p>
  <p>key2: "value2"</p>
<p>}
<p>Inversly, if I were to question the category that I had placed our dear, and beloved 'Farley' into I could call:hash_example['farley'] and see that she has been assigned the key of 'cat'.
<h2>Conclude:</h2>
  <p>There are still many, many, many, many, many, (yes....), many more things that could be stated regarding hashes, arrays, and the way in which to sort data. I will update and return to this posting as my learning continues.</p>
