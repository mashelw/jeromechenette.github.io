<p><b>Issues in Tech</b></p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>It is difficult to describe "our modern world" without resorting to blanketed descriptive declarations - like "our modern world"- but I continue regardless...</p>
<p>There is a balance that has yet to be reached between the business needs of timely and cost effective software development and sound testing of security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>While privacy issues are being brought to public discourse, government and private collection of data and metadata being reviewed by the court of social media buzz, and cyber-security language assimilated into the popular vernacular, where does the responsibility of security breaches lay? Many corporations feel their consumer base retreat after a publicize cyber attack but the attention span of the general public is forgiving, and the cultural psychosis denies any problem. Large businesses still are able to ignore discovered and disclosed security exploits. While bug bounty programs have created the environment for safe and confidential environments where hackers are properly financially compensated for divulging their findings often times companies will ignore or simply fail to act on these disclosures.</p>
<p>Currently the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act may allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies; new insights from Edward Snowden has revealed a torrent of injustices against the American Public via privacy breaches from the NSA. While lawful guidelines are being created, and cultural values questioned how are companies reasonably expected to comply, act, and react to a consumer base that wants privacy, a business model that is build on targeted ad revenue, and a government that wants to encrypt data so long as they can read it. </p>
<p>With this in mind – I believe that a problem in the tech industry is one of illiteracy.
Similarly to an uneducated voting citizen how are software developers expected
to responsibly build software without knowing the techniques that are used to break software.
</p>
<p>I am excited to see programming being exposed to children – I feel that a greater literacy will grow a better informed public in regards to what software they choose to engage with and why.</p>
