<p><b>Growth</b></p>

<p>Write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you:</p>
<p>The above values are all great things to add into our daily affirmations when thinking about ourselves and how we wish to be in the world. Some have to to with the intangible yet material aspirations, others are more visceral and sensitive to our deeper nature. I choose the value of Growth - it encompasses many values beneath it including will-power, self-reliance, physical challenges, personal development, introspection, knowledge, creativity.and adventure!</p>
<p>To challenge ourselves to continue to grow. Simple. Yet...sometimes illusive.</p>
<p>While this is the value that I hold to myself I can only hope that it extends to the manner in with I approach my relationships with others. Seeking avenues of connection and support, cooperative, creative, and insightful growth.</p>

<p><b>Explain how to use affirmation to help you succeed</b></p>
<p>"A general means for protecting the self from perceived threats and the consequences of failure is to allow people to affirm their self-worth. This can be done by encouraging people to think about their characteristics, skills, values, or roles that they value or view as important (Schimel, Arndt, Banko, & Cook, 2004). Frantz, Cuddy, Burnett, Ray, and Hart (2004), for example, showed that Whites who were given the opportunity to affirm their commitment to being nonracist were less likely to respond in a stereotypic fashion to an implicit measure of racial associations that had been described as indicative of racial bias...For students who self-affirmed, they were asked to indicate values that were important to them and to write a brief essay indicating why those values were important. For students who did not self-affirm, they indicated their least important values and wrote an essay why those values might be important to others."</p>

<p><b>Me?</b></p>
<p>I feel that self-affirming my own self worth and the values I wish to share with others can be strengthened when I integrate a self-reflective time to each and every day.</p>
<p><b>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</b></p>
<p>The last opportunity I had to examine a topic that someone came to me with seeking advice it dealt with "Their next bold move". This was a question that revolved around changing circumstances of a friend of mine - their dissatisfaction yet continued apathy in regards to all things.


<p><b>Did it relate to any of the values you found important?</b></p>
<p>Yes. I suppose. Exploring topics of depression, life circumstance, self-empowerment, explorations, enthusiasm, change...GROWTH!<p>

<p><b>How do you feel when you think about your values?</b></p>
<p>I feel string. Adaptable. Agile. Open to experience.</p>

<p><b>Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</b></p>
<p>I think that emotional growth and stability can be managed in balance with honest and sincere exposure in regards to our knowledge insufficiency.</p>
<p><b>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Strong mind, strong body.</p>
