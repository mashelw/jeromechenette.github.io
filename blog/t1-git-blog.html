      Welcome. Please relax, sit back, and enjoy participating in the process alongside me while we dive into the Dev bootcamp experience - Coding From An Empty Cup.

    <p><b>Version Control</b><p>
    <p>Imagine for a moment that you have created the beginnings what is to be the greatest, if not most influential novel ever to be written. The only caveat is that after the initial paragraph is written you must pass it on to an open community, a community of unknown contributors that will take it, read the first paragraph and then add a second paragraph, a third, a fourth, and so on. This process can revisited by anyone, at anytime. The greatest, if not most influential story ever written begins to branch; the story forks, a branch ends, another starts, and the story returns to the trunk, some branches are abandoned while others proved fruitful until it too is abandoned. In time, however, what might emerge from a combination of contributors is the revered and prophetic greatest, if not most influential novel ever to be written.
    </p>
    <p>Now. If you squint your eyes, smirk, and imagine this choatic semblence of a 'create your own adventure' model you may see how version control could aid in assembly.
    </p>
    <p>Version control allows a group of contributors to all work on a project simultaneously with the safeguards of not overwriting each others work. With each addition to the project (commit) the change is recorded and marked - branches are formed and noted - a project can revert back to before the change, or before a particular change occurred, once a change is fully tested, it can be merged back into the master branch. This proves extraordinarily useful with debugging, when working with large teams, when you desire to see when a particular feature was added to a bit a code.</p>
    <p><b>Git & GitHub</b><p>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system. Git lives locally on your computer while GitHub lives remotely on the internet/cloud/internet. GitHub is an online ‘hub’ - GitHub is a remote entity to which you’re ‘pushing’ (i.e uploading) stuff that would otherwise only exist locally AKA Git - through a workspace, a stage, and finally a central respository. Git allows you to work on your own copy until you are ready to pull in changes from contributors, and push back your own changes. Git has a third identical copy (A three tree architecture structure) you could both push and pull from to track changes and work from while tracking changes and pulling changes down from/to/receive/add the staging area and then making final commits to the repository/master branch.</p>
