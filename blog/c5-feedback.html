  <h1>Cultural Blog: Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
  <h4>February 15, 2015</h4>


    <p><b>Pairing:</b><p>
      <ul>
        <li>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>
        <li>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</li>
        <li>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pairing has proved to be an opportunity to visited challenges and work them out with both a backboard for exploration. I look forward to pairing. It brings an opportunity to utilize newly learned material, expose me to information I have yet to discover and explore new models of execution.  At times I have been at a loss and this has helped me when the roles have been reversed.</p>
      <p>When an opportunity arises that I have a good idea concerning the challenge I feel that it helps me to review the material that I have learned and solidify it by articulating it verbally and by example.</p>
      <p>When the opportunity arises that I am at a loss as to the next step I am presented with the opportunity to be guided in a direction and learn from others experience. </p>
      <p><b>Feedback:</b><p>
        <ul>
          <li>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</li>
          <li>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</li>
          <li>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</li>
          <li>How was it to write feedback?</li>
          <li>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</li>
        </ul>

<p>Feedback has been a challenge. There was one feedback submission that I received that stated "I was rarely comfortable expressing themselves clearly and concisely" & "The Pair felt rarely inspired and motivated by me." This, of course made me feel concerned by the manner in which I communicated with my pair. While this was only one of the 11 Feedbacks that I have yet to receive (all the remainder had positive things to say) it struck me. It motivated me to think about how to better express myself, my knowledge, and my enthusiasm.</p>
<p>This is an example of how feedback, even negative, has been helpful</p>
<p>The "Ask": Actionable, Specific, Kind.</p>
<p>This sets up a nice model for me to structure my feedback and evaluate how things went, and how they could be improved upon.</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of writing feedback is in concerns to the bubble checkmarks. They leave little room for explanation in regards to the rating. I plan on address this in my next feedback assignment</p>
