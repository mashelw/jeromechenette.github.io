  <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
  <h4>February 1, 2015</h4>

<p><b>Research your thinking style</b></p>
<p>Notes from: http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm </p>
<p><b>Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> This quality allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications. "It is not always what it seems."<p>
  <p>Random: Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.</p>
  <p><b>ABSTRACT RANDOM</b></p>
  <p>This learner likes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to listen to others</li>
    <li>bringing harmony to group situations</li>
    <li>establishing healthy relationships with others</li>
    <li>focusing on the issues at hand</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They learn best when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in a personalized environment</li>
    <li>given broad or general guidelines</li>
    <li>able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
    <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What's hard for them?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Having to explain or justify feelings</li>
    <li>Competition</li>
    <li> Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
    <li>Working in a restrictive environment</li>
    <li>Working with people who don’t seem friendly</li>
    <li>Concentrating on one thing at a time</li>
    <li>Giving exact details</li>
    <li>Accepting even positive criticism</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Multimodal Learner: </b></p>
<p>Notes from:http://www.davidlazeargroup.com/free_articles/multi-modal.html</p>
<p>"In a nutshell it means that the more different ways you learn something the more you will really learn it!"</p>
<ul>
  <li>Image Smart: Visual</li>
  <li>Body Smart: Kentic</li>
  <li>Logic Smart: Organizational/Mathmatical</li>
  <li>Nature Smart: Relational</li>
  <li>Sound Smart: Auditory</li>
  <li>Word Smart: Lingusitic</li>
  <li>People Smart: Interpersonal</li>
  <li>Self Smart: Intrapersonal</li>
</ul>

<p>Abstract Random (AR) Thinker && Multimodal Learner</p>

<p>What to say?</p>
<p>While I have known this about myself for quite some time I have never solidified it with a formal evaluation. This is amusing seeing as it plays a role in much of how I go about interpreting and interacting with the world.</p>
<p>I have always had my learning setting suited to my needs. A comfortable environment where I can control particular elements and monitor the level of ditracting information</p>
<p>I have always learned best when I can engage with the material on a mutitude of levels while at the same time entertaining the subject matter in conversation with others</p>
<p>I have always sought to be more co-operative rather than competative. While I see value in both I tend towards the former while attempting to engage with the latter</p>

<p><b>Consider strategies for adapting your learning to your thinking style</b></p>
<p>I have sought avenues of learning that expose me to video, audio books, written word, and discourse in order to survey the information landscape thoroughly.</p>


<p><b>Formulate ways to expand the ways you learn and think</b></p>
<p>I plan on continuing to expand the ways that I learn. I am eager to engage in person with the cohort now that I am back in San Francisco.</p>
<p><b>Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you?</b></p>
<p>The pairing sessions have been a solidifying experience. It allowed me to take the information that I had garnered, the problem solving techniques that I had developed and put them to use in conversational form</p>
<p>The biggest struggle has been when I have been confronted with a problem to which I could not forsee the solution while lacking to utilize the community as a resource.</p>

<p>At times I admit that I have neglected the mathmatical methodologies from my area of expertise. With that admittance I have stayed grounded on the belief that my brain can develop its understanding</p>
