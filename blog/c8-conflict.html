  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h4>March 8, 2015</h4>


    <p><b>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</b><p>
      <p>Perhaps this is an example of selective memory. Perhaps an example of the peace keeper within that downloads Fifty-Sades of Gray audio recording in the event that I start to receive an unrelenting torrent of unsolicited phone calls. This is a solution that I deemed both warranted and compassionate. I am fully aware that the human being on the other end of the line is not acting on their own motivation; I know that they are simply the extension of a faceless beast of an organization that we will call Comcast.</p>
      <p><b>What was the source of the conflict?</b><p>
        <p>While the specifics of the case will remain private I will simply say that the source of the conflict was both feeling violated in terms of what agreement I had entered into as well as powerless in the face of a giant organization.</p>
        <p><b>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</b><p>
          <p>Frustration, anger...then humor in the absurdity of it all.</p>
          <p><b>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</b><p>
            <p>At this point I wish I could say that I changed my phone number to a pay per call - thereby charging Comcast each and every time they called me. But alas - no. While discussions remained polite - the logic that drove them did not. I resolved my emotions of anger and frustration by formulating a better understanding and redefining the terms of our relationship.</p>
            <p><b>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</b><p>
              <p>"Peace is not absence of conflict, it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means."</p>
                 <p><b>What did you learn from this experience?</b><p>
<p>"If you want to bring an end to long-standing conflict, you have to be prepared to compromise."</p>
