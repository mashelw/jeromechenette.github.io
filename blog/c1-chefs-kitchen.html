    <p><b>Consider DBC's culture and approach to learning</b><p>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
    <p>Restaurant Mindset vs. Kitchen Mindset - Product Being Served(consumer Mode) vs. We Are All In This Together(Creator Mode).<p>
      <p>I appreciate the self motivation and collaborative effort that will be required by participants in this upcoming cohort - its inspiring. It is a fresh feel to the traditional model of passive learning that most of us have become accustomed to. </p>

    <p>Two Fears: I am Happy that these were highlighted in the video.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>1)"OH God i don't know that much about ruby, I am going to be discovered - imposter syndrome."</li>
    <li>"I am going to be amongst mediocre people- they will drag me down."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Rabbit Holes: how deep you go vs. how wide you go? : This is an issue that i am happy was addressed - And its something that I hope timeboxing will assist with.</p>

  <p>Exposing your own ignorance: This is generally a difficult thing to do in the world of professional illusion. Exposing vulnerability is a difficult thing to do in a working environment where knowing the right answer has always been the prominent and respectful goal. </p>

  <p>Engineering principles (bricks vs. design): Nicely stated.</p>

  <p>Pair Programing: The hardest thig to navigate - human beings (where companies fail - its where they thrive): This brings to light the imporatance of Engineering Empathy and the soft skills that I will be working tawards.</p>



    <p><b>Predict how you will react to DBC's approach</b><p>

    <p>I have already been exposed to so much knowledge regarding the underlying cognitive functions that can assist in my learning. One of the things that truck me about DBC is not simply the material covered but how it was going to be communicated, how it is that I will come to understand my own learning, and how this will benefit me and my professional career in the future.

    </p>

    <p><b>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?</b><p>

    <p>My take on DBC is that there will be some challenges ahead - and that these challenges present a new opportunity to refactor my wetware to be better capable and more efficient in its integration.

    </p>




    <p><b>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</b><p>

    <p>I am excited and interested in growing into this culture.
    </p>

    <p><b>Have your expectations of DBC changed?</b><p>

    <p>My expectations for myself and the DBC community grow everyday!
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p><b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</b><p>

    <p>Extremely
    </p>

    <p><b>Does it make you nervous?</b><p>

    <p>I would be nervous if I wasn't nervous. Yes. With each new environment the nerves always come out and start to dance! I suppose the key to to acknowledge that while my body may be feeling these things, breath and focus can bring me back to center. ;)
