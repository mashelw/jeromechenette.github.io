        <h4>What is pair programming?</h4>
        <p>
          Is programing with another person on the same piece of work together. There are two roles: a driver and a navigator. The driver writes the code, the navigator reviews the code as it's typed and keeps in mind the strategy and direction of the work. The programmers switch frequently.

        <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
        <p>
          Because pairing is commonly done at work. Pairing also helps to calibrate peoples skills. More experienced people can teach, which reinforces their knowledge. where newbies can rapidly learn from others when pairing more experienced programmers.

       <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>
        <p>
          A driver types on the keyboard, and focus on the actual implementation. Where as the navigator thinks about the overall strategy and double checks the drivers code. The navigator also frees up the driver from having to look up documentation ore references.
