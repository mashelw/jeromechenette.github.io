  <h2>Coding From An Empty Cup</h2>
  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>February 20, 2015</h4>


    <p><b>Stereotype Threat</b><p>
<p>"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group"</p>
<p>This is a sensitive look at the underlying currents that govern how many of us perform when events come into conflict that may threaten a perceived sense of identity that we may have developed in our lives. This "social identity" that comes from our group memberships and social categories that we belong - race, gender, age, profession, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental health status. The importance of this identity in its role as it effects our performance depends on the occurrence of conflict or confrontation that that identity - contingencies - who is "we".</p>
    <p><b>- Explain the symptoms and consequences of stereotype threat</b></p>
    <p>When this identity is ties to a sense of lack of ability, an inherit sense of expectations, or a negative stereotype about one of your identities is relevant for which you may be reduced to that identity alone - that prospect is distressing and may affect your actions in the world.</p>
    <p>Consequences:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Decreased performance</b></li>
    <li><b>Internal Attributions for Failure</b></li>
    <li><b>Reactance</b> - Stereotype threat can produce the opposite effects, actually increasing quality of performance, in some circumstances.  This can occur when stereotypes are strongly and explicitly instantiated and is especially likely when individuals are already high achieving and capable</li>
    <li><b>Ironic effects</b> - Stereotype threat can cause behavioral consequences that are opposite to the intention of the individual. Frantz, Cuddy, Burnett, Ray, and Hart (2004) demonstrated that Whites performance on an implicit measure of racial associations was worse (indicating stronger race-based beliefs) when they were told that the test assessed racial bias (raising the specter of confirming White racism). However, allowing individuals to self-affirm as being non-racist before taking the test eliminated this effect. Goff, Steel, and Davies (2008) also showed that Whites who thought they were to discuss a racially-sensitive topic with other Black students choose to sit further away from their interaction partners. Both studies demonstrate that threat of confirming the stereotype of White racism tended to ironically increase behavior consistent with that stereotype.</li>
    <li><b>Self-handicapping</b></li>
    <li><b>Task discounting</b></li>
    <li><b>Distancing the self from the stereotyped group</b></li>
    <li><b>Disengagement and disidentification</b></li>
    <li><b>Altered professional identities and aspirations</b></li>
	</ul>
    <p><b> Create strategies for combating stereotype threat</b></p>
    <p>Below is listed a short list of strategies that have been suggested for combatting stereotype threat listed on http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.<p>
   <ul>
   <li>Deemphasizing threatened social identities</li>
   <li>Encouraging self-affirmation</li>
   <li>Emphasizing high standards with assurances about capability for meeting them</li>
   <li>Providing role models</li>
   <li>Providing external attributions for difficulty</li>
   <li>Emphasizing an incremental view of intelligence</li>
   </ul>

   <p><b>My Personal Strategy</b></p>
   <p>Of the listed strategies, I wish discuss how I would like to implement one:</p>
   <p>"Emphasizing high standards with assurances about capability for meeting them"</p>

   <p>This challenge has brought awareness of the issue to the forefront of my mind. I hope that it will guide me to better understand the undercurrents that may dictate my own inner workings as well as the inner workings of my fellow cohorts, co-workers, family and friends. This strategy will be something that I incorporate when I give feedback to those that may be struggling as well as myself in times of struggle. I found that the examples by Claude M. Steele to be moving: The feedback you give can have a tremendous on its recipient. He sited two cases of discouraged students in which a narrative was formulated that validated the discouragement and then led the story to a place of success. This would be akin to communicating how I once had trouble iterating through sub-arrays and understanding classes which then led me to study more, engage in more conversation of the subject matter and, ultimately, creating my first application. {aired with this success story, I can imagine, communicating your honest understanding to the participants capabilities to be crucial in assisting them from dismissing any stereotype threats that may be causing inner turmoil; "I know you are having a ghard time with this, but I have 100% confidence that you are capable of figuring out."  </p>

   <p><b>Impostor Syndrome</b></p>
   <p>I would like to shift focus here to briefly discuss 'Impostor Syndrome'. Impostor Syndrome, while occurrence is discussed mostly amongst high achieving women, effects us all. "Impostor Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved."</p>
   <p>Strategies that are suggested for this are: To change how you talk to yourself about your skills and successes, reflection, writing down your accomplishments, and confirming your skills from others</p>
   <p>I feel that I have, from time to time, experienced - Impostor Syndrome. At times I wondered if anyone placed in roles of responsibilities are there simply as a result of happenstance or are they competent in their role? I have a difficult time, even with hard work, believing that I deserve to be in the position that I am in.</p>
   <p>I will utilize the above strategies and attempt to overcome this condition.</p>
